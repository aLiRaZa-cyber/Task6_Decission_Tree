## Decision Tree in R

Decision trees are a graphical method to represent choices and their consequences. It is a popular data mining and machine learning technique. It is a type of supervised learning algorithm and can be used for regression as well as classification problems.

## Creating Decision Tree by using R:
### Classification Decision Tree:

A classification tree is very similar to a regression tree except it deals with categorical or qualitative variables. In a classification tree, the splits in data are made based on questions with qualitative answers, therefore, the residual sum of squares cannot be used as a measure here. Instead, classification trees are created based on measures like classification error rate, cross-entropy, etc..

### Loading required R packages For Decision Tree:

* Load Recquired Packages:
  + **datasets:** for loading iris datasets.
  + **rpart.plot** Plot an rpart model, automatically tailoring the plot for the model's response type. 
  + **rpart:** Rpart is a powerful machine learning library in R that is used for building classification and regression trees. 
  
### Data Sets:
The task is to used Iris data sets:

#### Data Source:
This data set is already build into RStudio, so it is easy to find.

Iris data set is not huge, probably advanced R programmes or data scientists would find it rather unsuitable, but for, as a lady and begginer in big data analytics, this is a great place to start and show some simple tricks to plot and analyze this data set.

### Loading Data sets
Load the Iris data sets that is mandatory for completing the task:
```{r echo=TRUE}
library(datasets)
data("iris")
```
Iris dataset gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

### To inspect dataset:
Check the upper value of datasets:
```{r echo = TRUE}
head(iris, 10)
```

Check the bottom, value of dataset:
```{r echo= TRUE}
tail(iris, 10)
```

According the view of dataset the same type of data repeats agains, thats creates an issues while training and testing the datasets.

For this we shuffle the datasets.

### Shuffling:
 We shufle the datasets for training and testing the datasets.
```{r echo=TRUE}
shuffle_iris <- sample(1 : nrow(iris))
head(shuffle_iris)


#to initialized the shuffle value
iris_data <- iris[shuffle_iris,]
```
 
 To inspexct the shufle value:
 
```{r echo = TRUE}
 head(iris_data,10)
```
 
```{r echo = TRUE}
 tail(iris_data,10)
```

So, according to the table the iris data is **randomized**in datasets thats good for **training** and **testing phase**.

### Model

Create a model of training and testing the data for decission tree.
```{r echo=TRUE}
create_train_test <- function(data, size = 0.8, train = TRUE) {
  n_row = nrow(data)
  total_row = size * n_row
  train_sample <- 1: total_row
  if (train == TRUE) {
    return (data[train_sample, ])
  } else {
    return (data[-train_sample, ])
  }
}

```

## Create Dimension Tree According to Species 

### Train the Datasets:

```{r echo=TRUE}
iris_train <- create_train_test(iris_data , size = 0.8, train = TRUE)
```

### Testing the Datasets
```{r echo=TRUE}
iris_test <- create_train_test(iris_data , size = 0.8, train = FALSE)
```

### Comparison:

**Rows and Columns of Randomized Dataset:**
```{r eval=TRUE}
dim(iris_data)
```
 

**Rows and Columns of Training Dataset:**
```{r eval=TRUE}
dim(iris_train)
```


**Rows and Columns of Testing Dataset:**
```{r eval=TRUE}
dim(iris_test)
```

### Verify

To verify the randomized datasets according to species

**In Training Case**
```{r echo=TRUE}
prop.table(table(iris_train$Species)) # Returns conditional proportions given margins,
```

**In Testing Case**
```{r echo=TRUE}
prop.table(table(iris_test$Species))
```

In both case the result is about 33 percent same.


### Build the model:
```{r echo=TRUE}
library(rpart) #for training
library(rpart.plot) #for plot the decission tree
```
 
Model: 
```{r echo=TRUE}
fit <- rpart(iris_train$Species~. , data = iris_train , method = "class")
rpart.plot(fit, extra = 106)
```

### Make a Prediction:
Predict the test dataset:
```{r echo=TRUE}
predict_unseen <- predict(fit, iris_test, type = "class")
table_mat <- table(iris_test$Species ,predict_unseen)
table_mat
```

###Check Accuracy Rate:
```{r echo=TRUE}
accuracy_test <- sum(diag(table_mat)) / sum(table_mat)
print(paste("Accuracy for Test is ", accuracy_test))
```

## Decission Tree By Petal Length

```{r echo=TRUE}
prop.table(table(iris_train$Petal.Length))
```


```{r echo=TRUE}
prop.table(table(iris_test$Petal.Length))
```

Model:


```{r echo=TRUE}
fit_1 <- rpart(iris_train$Petal.Length~. , data = iris_train , method = "class")
rpart.plot(fit_1, extra = 106)
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
predict_unseen <- predict(fit, iris_test, type = "class")
table_mat <- table(iris_test$Petal.Length ,predict_unseen)
table_mat
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
accuracy_test <- sum(diag(table_mat)) / sum(table_mat)
print(paste("Accuracy for Test is ", accuracy_test))
```
